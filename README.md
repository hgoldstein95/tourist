# Tourist

Tourist is a tool for writing and viewing interactive documentation. A
**tour** is a series of locations throughout a codebase, along with
accompanying prose that explains the importance each location in turn. A
maintainer of a project can more effectively introduce newcomers to the
project by setting up one or more tours for the codebase that highlight the
relevant functional components. A person implementing a complex feature or
workflow can use a tour to solicit feedback from other people who are
familiar to the codebase, but not that particular logical flow.
